As someone who speaks the language of machines, I've carved out this cozy nook in cyberspace.  It's where my ideas take flight and thoughts find a home.   Here, you'll find a blend of in-depth technical deep dives, spontaneous reflections, and insights gleaned from years of navigating the digital landscape.

If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [sanathkandikanti@gmail.com](mailto:sanathkandikanti@gmail.com). You can also message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanathkandikanti/?originalSubdomain=in), though I tend to give longer responses over email.
