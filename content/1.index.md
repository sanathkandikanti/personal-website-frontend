Hi, I am Sanath.

#description

I'm an engineer who specializes in talking to computers. <br><br>

This is my little corner on the internet where I share my ideas and dump my thoughts—whether it's technical deep dives, random musings, or lessons learned along the way. Feel free to explore and reach out!
